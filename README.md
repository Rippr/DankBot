DankBot - A Telegram Bot that sends, generates, and **deep fries** memes.

# Why DankBot?
DankBot has been an extremely fun project to work on. <br><br>
The idea itself started off as a joke - My friends and I would often reference memes
in our conversations and wishfully discuss a tool that would share memes in response 
to certain triggers. While the idea of making a bot had occurred to me, the fact
that Whatsapp, our primary communications app, didn't have a public API was discouraging.
<br><br>
Later, when I found out about Telegram's rich bot culture, I was thrilled
and began this project on the 4th of September 2018.

### Major Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Pillow (Python Imaging Library)
- OpenCV-Python (Python bindings for the Open Computer Vision library)
- Numba
- Python Telegram Bot (Wrapper over the Telegram API)
- Papertrail API

### Things I've Learnt
- Building stateless, event-driven bots
- Detecting text and eyes in images using OpenCV
- Manipulating images with PIL
- Extracting frames from a video and making videos from a series of frames using OpenCV + imutils.
- Using Numba JIT and asynchronous execution to improve performance
- Applying binary search on discrete functions (Used to calculating optimum text size in the meme generator)
- Uploading images to Imgur with PyImgur
- Using papertrail API for centralized logging
- Static log analysis (DankBot Stats)

# Using DankBot

## Basic Commands
Each of these commands trigger a certain response. <br>
For most commands, there are multiple responses from which one is randomly picked.

- Hmmm
- Boom son
- Just do it
- E
- Hello there
- I don't think so
- Wut / Wat / Dude what / What even / What the
- Ironic
- F / RIP
- ???

## Advanced Commands

### ABC, not XYZ
Generates a meme using either the Robbie Rotten, Babushka, or Drake template in which ABC is chosen over XYZ.

### Alt: ABC
Converts text that follows the colon to aLt CaSe. It deletes the trigger message if bot has admin rights.

### Vaporize: ABC
Converts text that follows the colon to Vaporwave text. It deletes the trigger message if bot has admin rights.

### ðŸ…±
Replaces the first consonant group of each word with a ðŸ…±. <br>
It doesn't replace those consonants which can (mostly) be pronounced after a B.

### Alexa / Dankbot play Despacito \[x\]
Sends a GIF of the Despacito music video along with an audio file of Despacito. <br>
If a number x is given, certain effects are applied to the audio. <br>
If not, the audio file has a 10% chance of being extremely bass boosted. <br>

### T: ABC B: XYZ
Creates a meme with the provided captions when the message is a reply to an image.
ABC is the top-text and XYZ is the bottom-text.
By default, the captions are converted to upper case.
Replacing T with Ts and B with Bs prevents auto-capitalization.


## Deep Fryer
The Deep Fryer fries images, GIFs, or videos (Experimental).
Frying includes increasing saturation & contrast, and adding noise, emojis, laser eyes, and bulges.

The action is triggered by replying to a message containing a media file with one of the following commands:

- Fry: 1 cycle of frying.
- Nuke: 3 cycles of frying.
- Tsar Bomba: 5 cycles of frying.

#### Additional parameters

**Deep:** High contrast and saturation increase. <br>
**Shallow:** Low contrast and saturation increase. <br><br>

**High-fat:** Emojis are increased. <br>
**Low-fat:** Emojis are reduced. <br>
**No-fat:** Emojis aren't added. <br><br>

**Heavy:** Extra bulges are added. <br>
**Light:** No bulges are added. <br><br>

**Vitamin-B:** (Experimental) Adds the B emoji on text in the image. <br>
**Chilli:** (Experimental) Adds laser eyes.
